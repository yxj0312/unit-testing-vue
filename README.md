# unit-testing-vue

## Spec meaning

Spec stands for specification because in this file we are essentially specifying how the AppHeader component ought to behave, and testing that behavior.
Note that these file names must include “spec.js” — without it, they won’t be run when we use the ```npm run test:unit``` script.
